    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>&#9679;This is my final project for CSCI 2440 - 01 Client Side Programming from Saint Paul college.</p>
    <p>&#9679;Project contents:
        <ul>
            <li>Part 01:
                <p>
                    Download and install the script.aculo.us libraries and read through the documentation. Browse through the various pages listed on the right side of http://madrobby.github.com/scriptaculous/demos/  as well as the various demos. Find at least three effects which interest you and were not covered in class. 
                <br> <br>
	                Create a mockup of a front page only for a fictional retail website and name the file final-part1.html. Feel free to either create the site from scratch or to start with one of the templates found at www.templated.co. Incorporate the three different effects from scriptaculous into this webpage. Be prepared to demonstrate how the various effects work on the last day of class. 
                <br> <br>
	                Since the effects used will vary widely from student to student, exact details/parameters for creating this webpage have not been given. However, consider this webpage to be part of a portfolio project which you would show to a potential employer to demonstrate both your Javascript and overall web design skills. 

                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>Part 02:
                <p>
                    Review the animation on a path example used in the baseball assignment. Plan out a similar project which changes the CSS properties of at least three different objects over time after a &#39;Start&#39; button has been clicked. Consider changing at least three of the following CSS properties over time:  position, color, opacity, visibility, background-image, height, width. Save the result as final-part2.html. Be prepared to demonstrate the website on the last day of class. 
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>Part 03:
                <p>
                    Browse through the following tutorials at:
                    <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>http://inspire.blufra.me/35-cool-jquery-and-css-animation-effects/</a></li>
                        <li>http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/03/jquery-effects.html</li>
                        <li>http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/01/10/22-brilliant-and-advanced-jquery-effects-to-wow-your-visitors/</li>
                        <li>http://spyrestudios.com/jquery-tutorials-plugins-impress-your-friends/</li>
                        <li>http://designshack.net/articles/javascript/40-awesome-jquery-plugins-you-need-to-check-out/</li>
                        <li>http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/20-useful-jquery-sliders--cms-25960</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br> <br>
                    and find one that interests you and involves images. Read through the documentation carefully and create a separate webpage from Part 1 &amp; 2 for the final project which demonstrates this jQuery effect. Some of these examples require you to download extra code from the tutorial, please read the instructions carefully. Provide your own images for this example.  Keep this page as simple as possible so that just the jQuery effect is demonstrated. Include a link at the bottom of the page which points back to where you found the tutorial. 
                    
                    <br> <br>
                    Be prepared to teach the class how to use this effect on the last week of class. For your presentation, walk the class through the code and then demonstrate what happens when various HTML, CSS, Javascript and/or jQuery parameters are modified.
